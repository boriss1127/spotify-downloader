Spotify Downloader

To download, double click the .exe. Ignore the Windows Defender alert. The app will install. Then you should search for "Spotify Downloader" in the Windows Search bar.

Input a link to a Spotify track/playlist/album, and hit download. It will find the video on Youtube, and will download it as a MP3/MP4 version of the video, depending on what you selected. 

It will download in your Downloads folder, in a folder called "Spotify Downloads". If it's just a song, it will download in the raw .mp3/4 form. If it's an album/playlist it will download in a zipped format that you can unzip to access the songs.

PATCH NOTES-

v1.0.0 - Release 1
v1.0.1 - Release 2. The app used to download video and audio separately to get them both the highest quality, and then merge them together using ffmpeg, but wouldn't merge them, if the user did not have ffmpeg installed. Now, it checks if you do have ffmpeg. If you do, it 
         uses the first method. If you don't it downloads them together. Note - Downloading them separately will give higher video and audio quality.
