Spotify Downloader

To download, double click the .exe. Ignore the Windows Defender alert. The app will install. Then you should search for "Spotify Downloader" in the Windows Search bar.

Input a link to a Spotify track/playlist/album, and hit download. It will find the video on Youtube, and will download it as a MP3/MP4 version of the video, depending on what you selected. 

It will download in your Downloads folder, in a folder called "Spotify Downloads". If it's just a song, it will download in the raw .mp3/4 form. If it's an album/playlist it will download in a zipped format that you can unzip to access the songs.
