# Spotify Downloader

---

## This open-source program downloads any song, playlist or album of your choice from Spotify.

---

To download, double click the .exe that you installed from the Releases tab on Github. When the Windows Defender alert pops up, press More Info, and then a new button should appear on the bottom left, that says Run. Press that. The app will install. Then you should search for "Spotify Downloader" in the Windows Search bar.
Input a link to a Spotify track/playlist/album, and hit download. It will find the video on Youtube, and will download it as a MP3/MP4 version of the video, depending on what you selected.
It will download in your Downloads folder, in a folder called "Spotify Downloads". If it's just a song, it will download in the raw .mp3/4 form. If it's an album/playlist it will download in a zipped format that you can unzip to access the songs.
